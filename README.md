Knurling is an effort to build better tooling for developing and debugging
Rust software for embedded systems.

We believe that developing for embedded systems should be no more difficult than
developing for hosted platforms. It should be possible to use the same workflows
and equally powerful tooling to develop applications and libraries for tiny
embedded systems as well as server-class hardware.

To that end, we want to enable:

* Space-efficient and real-time capable logging
* Integration into your standard `cargo run` and `cargo test` workflows
* Execution tracing
* Simple data logging and visualization straight into your IDE or Browser
